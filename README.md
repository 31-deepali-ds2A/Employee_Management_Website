## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/31-deepali-ds2A/Employee-Management.git
cd Employee-Management
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:

ini
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=employee_management
PORT=3000
Database Configuration
Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE employee_management;
Import the table structure from db_schema.sql (if provided) or run the following SQL to create a basic employees table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    role VARCHAR(50),
    date_of_joining DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
Ensure the database credentials in .env match your MySQL configuration.
